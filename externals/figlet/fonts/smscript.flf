flf2a$ 5 4 13 0 10 0 3904 96
SmScript by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Script
Includes ISO Latin-1
figlet release 2.1 -- 12 Aug 1994
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.
