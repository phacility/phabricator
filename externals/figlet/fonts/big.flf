Big by Glenn Chappell 4/93 -- based on Standard
Includes ISO Latin-1
Greek characters by Bruce Jakeway <pbjakeway@neumann.uwaterloo.ca>
figlet release 2.2 -- November 1996
Permission is hereby given to modify this font, as long as the
modifier's name is placed on a comment line.

Modified by Paul Burton <solution@earthlink.net> 12/96 to include new parameter
supported by FIGlet and FIGWin.  May also be slightly modified for better use
of new full-width/kern/smush alternatives, but default output is NOT changed.
