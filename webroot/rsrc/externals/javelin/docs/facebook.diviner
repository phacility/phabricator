Information specific to Javelin at Facebook.

= Building Support Scripts =

Javelin now ships with the source to build several libfbjs-based binaries, which
serve to completely sever its dependencies on trunk:

  - `javelinsymbols`: used for lint
  - `jsast`: used for documentation generation
  - `jsxmin`: used to crush packages

To build these, first build libfbjs:

  javelin/ $ cd externals/libfbjs
  javelin/externals/libfbjs/ $ CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make

Note that **you must specify CXX explicitly because the default CXX is broken**.

Now you should be able to build the individual binaries:

  javelin/ $ cd support/javelinsymbols
  javelin/support/javelinsymbols $ CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make

  javelin/ $ cd support/jsast
  javelin/support/jsast $ CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make

  javelin/ $ cd support/jsxmin
  javelin/support/jsxmin $ CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make

= Synchronizing Javelin =

To synchronize Javelin **from** Facebook trunk, run the synchronize script:

  javelin/ $ ./scripts/sync-from-facebook.php ~/www

...where `~/www` is the root you want to pull Javelin files from. The script
will copy files out of `html/js/javelin` and build packages, and leave the
results in your working copy. From there you can review changes and commit, and
then push, diff, or send a pull request.

To synchronize Javelin **to** Facebook trunk, run the, uh, reverse-synchronize
script:

  javelin/ $ ./scripts/sync-to-facebook.php ~/www

...where `~/www` is the root you want to push Javelin files to. The script
will copy files out of the working copy into your `www` and leave you with a
dirty `www`. From there you can review changes.

Once Facebook moves to pure git for `www` we can probably just submodule
Javelin into it and get rid of all this nonsense, but the mixed SVN/git
environment makes that difficult until then.

= Building Documentation =

Check out `diviner` and `libphutil` from Facebook github, and put them in a
directory with `javelin`:

  somewhere/ $ ls
  diviner/
  javelin/
  libphutil/
  somewhere/ $

Now run `diviner` on `javelin`:

  somewhere/ $ cd javelin
  somewhere/javelin/ $ ../diviner/bin/diviner .
  [DivinerArticleEngine] Generating documentation for 48 files...
  [JavelinDivinerEngine] Generating documentation for 74 files...
  somewhere/javelin/ $

Documentation is now available in `javelin/docs/`.

= Editing javelinjs.com =

The source for javelinjs.com lives in `javelin/support/webroot/`. The site
itself is served off the phabricator.com host. You need access to that host to
push it.
