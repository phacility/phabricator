Describes how to file an effective Phabricator bug report.

Include Reproduction Steps!
===========================

IMPORTANT: When filing a bug report, you **MUST** include reproduction
instructions. We can not help fix bugs we can not reproduce, and will not
accept reports which omit reproduction instructions.

For help, see @{article:Providing Reproduction Steps}.

Overview
========

Found a bug with Phabricator? Let us know! This article describes how to file
an effective bug report so we can get your issue fixed or help you work around
it.

The most important things to do are:

  - check the list of common fixes below;
  - make sure Phabricator is up to date;
  - make sure we support your setup;
  - gather debugging information;
  - explain how to reproduce the issue; and
  - create a task in
    [[ http://secure.phabricator.com/u/newbug/ | Maniphest ]].

The rest of this article walks through these points in detail.

If you have a feature request (not a bug report), see
@{article:Contributing Feature Requests} for a more tailored guide.

For general information on contributing to Phabricator, see
@{article:Contributor Introduction}.


Common Fixes
============

Before you file a report, here are some common solutions to problems:

  - **Update Phabricator**: We receive a lot of bug reports about issues we have
    already fixed in HEAD. Updating often resolves issues. It is common for
    issues to be fixed in less than 24 hours, so even if you've updated recently
    you should update again. If you aren't sure how to update, see the next
    section.
  - **Update Libraries**: Make sure `libphutil/`, `arcanist/` and
    `phabricator/` are all up to date. Users often update `phabricator/` but
    forget to update `arcanist/` or `libphutil/`. When you update, make sure you
    update all three libraries.
  - **Restart Apache or PHP-FPM**: Phabricator uses caches which don't get
    reset until you restart Apache or PHP-FPM. After updating, make sure you
    restart.


Update Phabricator
==================

Before filing a bug, make sure you are up to date. We receive many bug reports
for issues we have already fixed, and even if we haven't fixed an issue we'll
be able to resolve it more easily if you file a report based on HEAD. (For
example, an old stack trace may not have the right line numbers, which will
make it more difficult for us to figure out what's going wrong.)

To update Phabricator, use a script like the one described in
@{article:Upgrading Phabricator}.

**If you can not update** for some reason, please include the version of
Phabricator you are running when you file a report.

For help, see @{article:Providing Version Information}.


Supported Issues
================

Before filing a bug, make sure you're filing an issue against something we
support.

**We can NOT help you with issues we can not reproduce.** It is critical that
you explain how to reproduce the issue when filing a report.

For help, see @{article:Providing Reproduction Steps}.

**We do NOT support prototype applications.** If you're running into an issue
with a prototype application, you're on your own. For more information about
prototype applications, see @{article:User Guide: Prototype Applications}.

**We do NOT support third-party packages or instructions.** If you installed
Phabricator (or configured some aspect of it) using a third-party package or by
following a third-party guide (like a blog post), we can not help you.
Phabricator changes quickly and third-party information is unreliable and often
falls out of date. Contact the maintainer of the package or guide you used,
or reinstall following the upstream instructions.

**We do NOT support custom code development or third-party libraries.** If
you're writing an extension, you're on your own. We provide some documentation,
but can not help you with extension or library development. If you downloaded a
library from somewhere, contact the library maintainer.

**We do NOT support bizarre environments.** If your issue is specific to an
unusual installation environment, we generally will not help you find a
workaround. Install Phabricator in a normal environment instead. Examples of
unusual environments are shared hosts, nontraditional hosts (gaming consoles,
storage appliances), and hosts with unusually tight resource constraints. The
vast majority of users run Phabricator in normal environments (modern computers
with root access) and these are the only environments we support.

Otherwise, if you're having an issue with a supported first-party application
and followed the upstream install instructions on a normal computer, we're happy
to try to help.


Getting More Information
========================

For some issues, there are places you can check for more information. This may
help you resolve the issue yourself. Even if it doesn't, this information can
help us figure out and resolve an issue.

  - For issues with `arc` or any other command-line script, you can get more
    details about what the script is doing by adding the `--trace` flag.
  - For issues with Phabricator, check your webserver error logs.
    - For Apache, this is often `/var/log/httpd/error.log`, or
      `/var/log/apache2/error.log` or similar.
    - For nginx, check both the nginx and php-fpm logs.
  - For issues with the UI, check the Javascript error console in your web
    browser.
  - Some other things, like daemons, have their own debug flags or
    troubleshooting steps. Check the documentation for information on
    troubleshooting. Adjusting settings or enabling debugging modes may give
    you more information about the issue.


Reproducibility
===============

The most important part of your report content is instructions on how to
reproduce the issue. What did you do? If you do it again, does it still break?
Does it depend on a specific browser? Can you reproduce the issue on
`secure.phabricator.com`?

It is nearly impossible for us to resolve many issues if we can not reproduce
them. We will not accept reports which do not contain the information required
to reproduce problems.

For help, see @{article:Providing Reproduction Steps}.


Create a Task in Maniphest
==========================

If you're up to date, supported, have collected information about the problem,
and have the best reproduction instructions you can come up with, you're ready
to file an issue.

It is **particularly critical** that you include reproduction steps. We will
not accept reports which describe issues we can not reproduce.

(NOTE) https://secure.phabricator.com/u/newbug/

If you don't want to file there (or, for example, your bug relates to being
unable to log in or unable to file an issue in Maniphest) you can file on any
other channel, but we can address reports much more effectively if they're
filed against the upstream than if they're filed somewhere else.
